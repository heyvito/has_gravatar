# has_gravatar

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/victorgama/has_gravatar.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/victorgama/has_gravatar) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/victorgama/has_gravatar.png)](https://gemnasium.com/victorgama/has_gravatar)

has_gravatar is intended to add easy access to Gravatar URLs from ActiveRecord models.

## Installation

Add the following line to your `Gemfile`, depending on your Rails version:

### For Rails 5 and upward
```
gem 'has_gravatar', '~> 0.0.3'
```

### For Rails 4.2.6 and backwards
```
gem 'has_gravatar', '~> 0.0.2'
```

And install it:
```
$ bundle
```

After these two simple steps, has_gravatar is ready to be used on any ActiveRecord model.
In order to use it, call `has_gravatar`, passing one or more fields as argument. Example:
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
	has_gravatar :primary_email, :secondary_email, :email
end
```

Now, to get the Gravatar URL of a model, use:
```ruby
user = User.first

# Returns http://gravatar.com/avatar/<hash>
user.email_gravatar

# Supports default images
user.email_gravatar default_avatar: 'http://my.domain.com/public/default_gravatar.png'

# And sizing
user.email_gravatar default_avatar: 'http://my.domain.com/public/default_gravatar.png', size: 128

# And HTTPS
user.email_gravatar default_avatar: 'http://my.domain.com/public/default_gravatar.png', size: 128, secure: true

```
